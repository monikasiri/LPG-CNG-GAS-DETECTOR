# ðŸš¨ LPG/CNG Gas and Fire Detector with Telegram Alerts

### **Project Summary**
---
This project is a safety system designed to detect LPG/CNG gas leakage and fire. It uses a gas sensor, fire sensor, buzzer, LCD for local alerting, and a servo to open a door. It sends real-time alerts via Telegram using an ESP-based board connected over WiFi.

### **Abstract**
---
The system monitors gas concentration and fire presence using analog/digital sensors. In case of gas leakage or fire, it triggers a buzzer and activates safety actions like opening a door or enabling a sprinkler. It also sends real-time notifications to a predefined Telegram chat using the UniversalTelegramBot library.

### **Introduction**
---
This embedded IoT-based project focuses on gas and fire safety in homes or industries. It reads values from a gas and fire sensor, displays them on an LCD, activates response systems (buzzer, servo motor, and sprinkler), and sends status updates to a user via Telegram bot. The ESP8266/ESP32 manages the cloud communication.

### **Hardware Used**
---
- MQ Gas Sensor  
- IR Fire Sensor  
- 16x2 LCD Display  
- Servo Motor  
- Sprinkler (Relay Based)  
- Buzzer  
- ESP8266 / ESP32  
- WiFi Router  
- Power Supply  

### **Software Used**
---
- Arduino IDE (for coding and uploading)  
- Telegram App (for receiving alerts)  

### **Libraries Used**
---
- LiquidCrystal  
- Servo  
- WiFi / WiFiClientSecure  
- UniversalTelegramBot  
- ArduinoJson  

### **Algorithm Used**
---
- Continuously read gas sensor (analog) and fire sensor (digital)  
- If gas level > threshold â†’ trigger buzzer, open servo door  
- If fire detected â†’ activate buzzer and sprinkler  
- Format the alert string and send via Telegram bot using WiFi  
- Command options via Telegram: `/start`, `/led_on`, `/led_off`, `/state`  

### **How It Works**
---
1. System boots and connects to WiFi  
2. LCD displays real-time gas and fire readings  
3. If gas value > 300 â†’ buzzer ON, servo door opens  
4. If fire sensor reads high â†’ buzzer ON, sprinkler activated  
5. ESP receives alerts via serial and forwards them to Telegram  
6. Telegram bot responds to user commands and notifies emergencies
